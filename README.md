# Grout 🧱✨

Grout is the revolutionary, bleeding-edge🩸, blazingly slow⚡️, Python Powered 🐍🤮, programming language that will *not* change the way you code forever!

Why is it called Grout? It's because even though it exists, almost no one knows what it is or what it does! 🤷‍♂️

## Features 🚀

- **Blazingly Slow ⚡️**: With performance that rivals not writing code at all, Grout is built for the future.

- **Cutting Edge 🔪**: Grout keeps you on the bleeding edge of technology with the latest and greatest features.
- **Python-Powered 🐍**: Built with the inefficiency and safety of Python, ensuring your code is bad and unreadable.



## Why Grout? 🤔

- **Built for Developers, by Developers 💻**: We do not understand your needs and have designed Grout to be unintuitive and inefficient.

- **Memory Safety 🛡️**: Say goodbye to null pointer dereferences and buffer overflows. Say hello to your program taking up 80% of your RAM ✨.

- **Useless 🤹**: Grout is a new and useless language so that AI won't be able to learn it 🤖. 

- **Horrible Syntax 🤮**: Grout has a syntax that will make you want to gouge your eyes out. But that's all part of the fun! It would probably be easier to write BrainFuck!

## Example 💻

To see some examples of Grout code, you can check out the [examples](./examples) directory.


```rust
// Yes, this is a function definition
fn factorial -> int : int n {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    // Yes, this is a function call
    return n * factorial : (n - 1)
}

```

What's up with all the colons? We at the Grout foundation have absolutely no clue!

## Installation 💾

Getting started with Grout is as easy as 1-2!

1. Download the Grout interpreter from this very github repository.
2. Run the evaluator.py file with the path to your Grout code as an argument.

```bash
python evaluator.py path/to/your/code.grout
```
